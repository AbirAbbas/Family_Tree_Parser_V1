Limitations
*****************
- Cannot take over 5000 characters worth of CONT/CONCs
- Format must be strict
- Get Descendant requires its own delete!
- Currently cant handle double deletion (does not always check for NULL)
- Issues with individual deletes but deleteGEDCOM works properly
- doesn't like royal92.geds NAMING formats
- does not check for memory overflow!
